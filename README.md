Alright boys I'm writing this at 3:25am so ignore the spellig mistakes. I am going to layout the game plan for you noobs right now, feel free to ask a maximum of three questions tomorrow. I will answer no more. 

## Highest Priority:
* Messaging Interface <- I can focus on this
* User Authentication (OAuth2 or facebook)
* Data storage (!) <-- implement a easy solution first. Basic storage is first priority, web server or cloud storage would be impressive
* We should discuss the look of the app too. I want a good looking, probably hacky, app by 8:30pm
* Fix this README

## Medium Priority:
* Spotify connectivity
* Custom Cards (Koloda) View - this design is easily customizable https://github.com/Yalantis/Koloda
* Facebook Authentication (might be easiest way for authentication)

## Low Priority: I'll owe you guys dinner if we finish these
* cloud storage
* some sort of bandcamp/mp3 upload 

I'm going to leave around 9pm and I'll be back around 1 or 2am.
